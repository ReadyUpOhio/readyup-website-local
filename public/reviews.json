    "text": "Not only are all the workers at this game store consistently the most friendly and best Iâ€™ve seen in Ohio, but as someone who regularly sells and trades at this location, the deals that ultimately get made here are actually fair and not highway robbery like a lot of retro game stores tend to operate. The owners and employees here have a real sense of what it takes to turn a profit without taking advantage of and leaving their customers in the dust. If you have collectible games or cards, donâ€™t be afraid to give this place a stop. At the worst, youâ€™re supporting good people, and at the best, youâ€™re going into a reliable retro game store with great atmosphere and getting some awesome stuff!",

I have made several purchases and they have always done a great job. Good communication and willingness to go above and beyond. I never hesitate to reach out with a gaming need or refer to any of my friends. This was a no-brainer to give a 5 star review.",
